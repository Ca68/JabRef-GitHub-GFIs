However, I‚Äôm unsure about the best approach:\n\n1. **Create a new method** in JournalAbbreviationRepository that **specifically checks for fuzzy matches** on full journal names only, \nkeeping it separate from existing logic.\n2. **Extend getNextAbbreviation by adding additional logic to handle fuzzy matching** within the current method, integrating it as an optional enhancement.\n\nWould it be preferable to keep strict and fuzzy matching separate, or integrate the fuzzy logic into getNextAbbreviation?\n\nAlso, if I‚Äôm misunderstanding anything about how this should be handled, I‚Äôd really appreciate any clarification.\n\nThanks again!"

        "description": "## Why?\n\nTo implement https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6404, we need to track the source and destination libraries at the code level when copying entries.\n\nCurrently, tracking the state of a copy-paste operation across libraries is not straightforward. When a user copies an entry `(ctrl+c)` and pastes it `(ctrl+v)` into another library, JabRef copies the BibTeX data. This process loses any reference to the original library, and there is no way to track where the entry came from or establish cross-referencing between entries.\n\nWhile workarounds do exist, some of which are mentioned in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6404#issuecomment-2035852839, all of them introduce new problems; therefore, we need an additional copy-pasting mechanism/option.\n\n## How?\n\nAdd a context menu option called `copy to` to the `RightClickMenu`.\n\nThis option will open a submenu listing all currently open libraries in JabRef, excluding the active one. Selecting a library from the submenu will copy the selected entry to that library.\n\nCopying entries is not always straightforward. For example, when a potential duplicate in the destination library the duplicate resolver dialog will be triggered. Luckily, that code is implemented and it is a matter of figuring out where and how to call it.\n\nNote: We do not need to handle cross-references yet.\n\n## Definition of Done\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60620022-3738-4025-a928-3c532ab5db78)\n\n\\+ Unit tests to ensure the correct libraries are displayed in the submenu.\n\n",

Configure Citation Key Generator to use `[authorsAlpha]`\n2. Generate the citation key for an entry\n3. According to [the documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/v5/setup/citationkeypatterns#special-field-markers) for `[authorsAlpha]` the following should hold:\n   - One author: The first three letters of the last name\n   - Two to four authors: The first letter of the last name of each author\n   - More than four authors: The first letter of the first three authors' last name. A + is added at the end if it is not in the list of unwanted characters.\n4. Instead i get the following\n   - One author: The first _two_ letters of the last name (see Screenshot 1)\n   - Two to four authors: The first letter of the last name of each author (the same as documented)\n   - More than four authors: The first letter of the first _four_ authors' last name.

This allows text to be selected, but the formatting is ugly. Markdown is a de-facto standard for chat LLMs.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nUse Markdown in summary window.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nThere is a long-standing problem with JavaFX: you cannot select `Text` or `Label`. Only text in `TextField` or `TextArea` can be selected. However, text in `WebView` can be selected, and it is already used in JabRef in entry preview!\n\nThus, you have 2 options:\n\n1. Implement Markdown using `Text` or `Label`s and add a button `Copy` somewhere at the end.\n2. Implement Markdown using `WebView`.\n\nOption 1 is, I think, easier to implement, however option 2 is preferred\n",

Not only do I argue that being able to copy the raw text is important, also in the mid / long term, we want to be be able to edit responses directly in the JabRef UI, which will enable having and fixing longer conversations, even when the model at first responded inadequately (obviously something out of scope for this issue here). Finally, being able to look at the source, just like in biblatex source tab is important, otherwise we will have users that raise issues like these: https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/issues/864, which are basically formatting issues. Without the raw source, it is hard to debug them.</reason>"

By \"use Markdown\" I meant, that LLM models typically generate output not just in plain text, but in markdown (rich text), and we need a way to display a Markdown not in its source, but to apply it and stylize the text.\n\nBy \"1. Use Text or Labels for Markdown\" I meant to render Markdown as several Text elements with different CSS styles. For that you need a Markdown parser.\n\nBy \"2. Use WebView\" I mean using a web view component in summary tab. In this option you need to convert Markdown to HTML (I think JabRef already has something like that).\n\nThilo has proposed a new feature: toggling. It will allow you to switch between styles: one using TextArea (this is what we already have) and Markdown rendering (two options I told above). This will be a great plus if you implement option 1. If you implement option 2, then there would be no need to show Markdown source in TextArea, as users are able to copy from WebView"

It would be nice if I as user could navigate to the listed TeX file in the LaTeX editor by a double click.\n\n---\n\nThe resulting code will add a method `jumpToLine(Path fileName, int line, int column)` to `org.jabref.gui.push.PushToApplication`.\n\nAdd `default` empty implementation, to avoid compile errors at the beginning.\n\nHints\n\n2. Leave out configuration of each tool; reuse org.jabref.gui.push.PushToApplicationPreferences and hard-code the parameters to jump to a line\n3. Implement for `TeXstudio`. `texstudio --line \"$lineno\" \"$file\"`\n4. The `commandPath` contains the path tot he executable.\n5. Optionally: implement for more applications (e.g., `emacsclient +4:3 FILE`)\n6. Optionally: Add VSCode as new push target\n\nNote: The push to applications functionality is described at https://docs.jabref.org/cite/pushtoapplications.\n\n---\n\nExample:\n\n1. Open `src\\test\\resources\\pdfs\\IEEE\\ieee-paper.tex`\n2. Double click on \"Kopp et al.\"\n3. Select tab \"LaTeX ciations\" in entry editor\n4. Double click on the first entry in the table:\\\n    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dd455c1-7e56-4d19-93de-d7762fe550b7)\n5.

It is not directly related to this wish - you can only learn how things are implemented for a different use case.\n\nYou did not provide any context or test application - thus it makes difficult to point you to concrete classes.\n\nStart reading code at `org.jabref.gui.push.AbstractPushToApplication#pushEntries(org.jabref.model.database.BibDatabaseContext, java.util.List<org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntry>, java.lang.String, java.lang.ProcessBuilder)`. You can use Ctrl+click on a method to see where it is defined or where it is called.\n\n> This entry is called LatexCitationsTab. This tab is a java class that us javafx to set the preferences. But I don't what happened after the user double click it.\n\nCurerntly nothing. It is your task to add this functionality. See step 5 in the issue description (the part at \"Example:\")\n\n> How could I found the tex file path in this latex citations tab ?\n\n`org.jabref.model.texparser.Citation` is the object holding the `Path`. It is used at `org.jabref.gui.texparser.CitationsDisplay`. `CitationsDisplay` displays the citation.\n\n> I think this issue is about open the external tex editor. \n\nNot quite. It is to instruct the opened editor to JUMP to a lline.\n\nIt seems you never used LaTeX and BibTeX.\n\nHere two slides, maybe, they help to understand the goal:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f603711-cb59-429e-b361-8251a46f5495)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd6fb5b7-1f52-491b-8f6d-e978b6082989)\n\nImagine now that someone writes a book and has several .tex files. That person uses JabRef for editing the .bib file. Now, they want to have the text edtor jump to the .tex file where the current citation is used.\n\n> The commandPath is setted in the Preference. \n\nRetrieve it similarly to `preferences.getPushToApplicationPreferences()`.\n\n> The path and the line number is setted in the latex citations.\n\nIt is available in `org.jabref.model.texparser.Citation`.\n\n"

(Introcued at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10778 and https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10847)\n\nThe class for that is `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck`.\n\nThere is currently no UI.\n\nGoals:\n\n1. Add a new menu entry at Quality: \"Check consistency\" (below \"Check integrity\")\n2. This executes BibliographyConsistencyCheck on the whole library\n3. It presents a result window\n\nResult window:\n\nDisplays `org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck.Result`.\n\nUse each EntryType as heading (or do accordeons as in the FindUnlinkedFiles functionality)\n\nFor each EntryType in Result:\n\nDisplay org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheck.EntryTypeResult\n\n- Render as table\n- First column: Citation key\n- On click of a line : jump to entry (similar to behavior of `org.jabref.gui.search.GlobalSearchBar`)\n- other columns: Field names\n- content: \\\n                x | required field is present\n                o | optional field is present\n                ? | unknown field is present\n                - | field is absent\n\nSee org.jabref.logic.quality.consistency.BibliographyConsistencyCheckResultTxtWriterTest#checkDifferentOutputSymbols for a \"guide\" how to get the symbols. Just step through the code.\n\nIf no new tables are used, but a single table, this table would look as follows:\n\n![image](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/f64a73b7-7c3b-4d9d-b2b1-6cf33e24671a)\n\n(Taken from https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10778)",

                "body": "Hello, In this issue, I have successfully reproduced the RFC link import error in JabRef and observed that it can be found and imported correctly with the DOI format. This means that the problem may be in the parsing and importing function of the RFC link, rather than the overall problem of the ID import function. We can try the following two solutions:\n\n1. URL Correction: JabRef's quick import may not parse RFC links correctly. But I found that DOI format links can be recognized in 10.17487/RFC7276.![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ece6d261-1a84-4a97-a9fb-a2216aa7a7b1)\n Therefore, a potential solution is to add special processing logic for RFC urls in the code.\n\n2. Jabref supports RFC-specific parsers: JabRef currently supports successfully importing RFCs by explicitly selecting ID fetchers. If we can automatically detect the RFC format during the quick import process and call the RFC fetcher, the problem may be solved. I think the solution can be to detect whether it contains the word \"rfc\" when parsing the URL, and automatically select the RFC fetcher for processing. (For this solution, I can add a preprocessing module for RFC links: Add a preprocessing module to the quick import function to check whether the URL link conforms to the RFC link pattern. If it is an RFC link, it will be converted into a standard ID format that can be used for RFC fetcher, such as rfc7276, so that users do not need to do it manually.)"

I am a university student with an assessment which involves contributing to an open-source project (as many others seem to be).  \n\nAfter messing around with JabRef for a bit, I have noticed that in the New Entry window, it is possible to make the window too small, making buttons invisible or unreachable\n\nWhen everything fits onto the window:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e374b361-3a86-4eef-97f0-a42f641bd3b5)\n\nWhen the window is too small to fit all the element in\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c946460-0df1-4274-8d55-fe3d48bae2a6)\n\nWould it be possible for me to make a modification to give it a set minimum window size or an ability to ‚Äúscroll‚Äù the window when it doesn‚Äôt fit properly?

I understand the problem of elements becoming invisible or unreachable when the window is resized too small. I'd be happy to work on fixing this by:\n\n-Setting a minimum window size to prevent users from resizing the window too small, ensuring all elements remain visible and usable.\n-Alternatively, or additionally, I can add a scrollable view so that when the window is smaller, users can scroll to access any hidden elements.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to proceed with this solution, and feel free to assign the issue to me. I look forward to contributing!"

Convert test cases in `org.jabref.logic.util.FileNameCleanerTest` to [`@CsvSource`](https://mikemybytes.com/2021/10/19/parameterize-like-a-pro-with-junit-5-csvsource/)\n2. Add more test cases for Linux (as our CI only executes on Linux)\n\n---\n\nIf you have more time/energy, work on  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9992 and add test cases for Windows and MacOS to `FileNameCleanerTest`.",

The rename dialog appears - the whole filename is selected:\\\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1366654/225427814-214732cb-9636-4fe2-b695-776d76186d48.png)\n3.

I press <kbd>Enter</kbd>\n\n- Expected result: The file is named `demo.pdf`\n- Actual result: The file is named `demo` (without extension)\n\nJabRef should check whether the user removed the extension. If JabRef cannot find a new extension, it should put the old one (and not just keep the file as is)\n\nOther implementation possibility: The dialog should select the filename only - without extension.\n",

Everybody else, please choose another \"free to take\" issue from https://github.com/orgs/JabRef/projects/5\n\n### Why?\n\nWe have issues that are reserved (you can see it in the top right corner at the projects section), as grading requirements may differ and group work may not be permitted by some lecturers and in some courses.\n\nKeep also in mind that double work must not be, but can be inefficient. \n   - In principle, all issues are free to take, so if you are fast you could theoretically come up with your own solution first and propose a change, but since somebody already asked to be assigned to this issue and may already have started working on a fix, it could lead to disappointment and double work for the both of you. Ultimately only one of your pull-requests will be merged, so if your study course requires you to demonstrage a successfully merged commit this is a risky plan.\n   - Supervising two different pull-requests creates more work for maintainers, since they have to hop between pull-requests to compare them and communicate with the both of you.\n\n### Why not a first come first served?\nIn principle, you could work together on this issue (groupwork), but this would require good communication skills on your part. If all of you are willing, you should exchange contact details (e.g. via gitter/e-mail etc.), but this is probably really an easy fix, so the effort to coordinate is higher than the effort to simply fix the issue.\n\nAppart from that... happy coding!"

Let me know if this is in line with what you envisioned. I took some inspiration from IntelliJ and read that it would be ideal if pressing F2 worked like in VS Code. If I can‚Äôt implement that exact function, I‚Äôll set it up so that pressing F2 opens a rename group window.\n\nHere‚Äôs the link to the Figma and a video of the prototype. The window will look similar to the Edit Group window, but it will only allow renaming the group, with an OK button and an info link like in Edit Group.\n\n\nFigma link: https://www.figma.com/proto/0g7oIphWjyCAXed7DPaumH/Untitled?node-id=10-3&t=SQnrK3XeU4WWpQyA-1\n\nVideo:  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078d4cb1-50f5-4f4b-bd84-7f6f7bef4405\n"

I added the Rename Group option to the menu, I actually did the same thing as Edit Group, since I am inspired by Edit Group, and I also added my Dialog, which opens a window with Input in which we enter a new name, Cancel and OK button. And I just need to change the name of that group, as soon as I looked at the editGroup method in the GroupTreeViewModel class, the Dialog for the group actually opens there, and when changes are made, the inputs to this condition \"newGroup.ifPresent(group -> { \", if I understand it well, of course. Only when I try the same for the renameGroup method, an error pops up, which I will also send as it looks like. I will also send the RenameGroupDialog as I created it. How would you advise me to change the name of that group when I enter input?\n\n\nerror:   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7725e1-ac25-425d-9a55-e57e51f42102)\nrenameGroupDialogView : [RenameGroupView.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17612407/RenameGroupView.txt)\n\n\nI also send GroupThreeViewModel where the condition is.

Follow each and every step carefully mentioned in the [devdocs](https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace/) for setting up. Ideally, if you do so, you should be able to get it up and running.\r\n\r\nYou can also ask questions on the [gitter chat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#JabRef_jabref:gitter.im)."

The PMID can also be used to visit the record on PubMed, fetch additional data, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe MEDLINE importer should include the `PMID` element from pubmed/medline files.\r\n\r\nSee [MEDLINE/PubMed Data Element (Field) Descriptions](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html) for information about the elements included in PubMed text files.\r\n",

Please correct me, but I believe it is possible to achieve similar functionality than field markers by using Regular Expressions and modifiers. For example, `:regex(\"pattern\", \"replacement\")` is your swiss army knive for all types of patterns and in your case specifically, `:truncateN` might be fitting replacement for `[veryshorttitle]`, which is basically a simple `:truncate1`. See the section about modifiers in the documentation: https://docs.jabref.org/setup/citationkeypatterns#modifiers. Modifiers can be used with most field names.

In the existing MathSciNet.java lines 121-122 (linked below), the following is present:\r\n[jabref/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/MathSciNet.java](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/2a7fc1aa0e2bc3edad3291e96a40087cded4da03/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fetcher/MathSciNet.java#L121-L122)\r\n\r\n```\r\nString bibTexFormat = entriesArray.getJSONObject(i).getString(\"bibTexFormat\");\r\nentries.addAll(bibtexParser.parseEntries(bibTexFormat));\r\n```\r\nThis assumes that there is a \"bibTexFormat\" field in the JSON object that contains a string representing the complete BibTeX entry. The value of that field is retrieved and parsed using the BibtexParser. However, if the JSON format doesn't include the bibTexFormat field or if the field doesn't contain a valid BibTeX string, these lines would fail to parse the entries correctly. And that is the case with the json for \"search\" as posted above by @TimAlderson . So correct me if I'm wrong, is a conversion mechanism needed for both the \"all\" case and the \"results\" case? Or is there a simpler way?"

The fetched entries are held cached in RAM until JabRef is restarted. This approach unnecessarily bloats the computer memory and could result in an out-of-memory exception in special circumstances. \r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\nInstead of caching all entries, we could cache the citation relations of the top N entries that are most likely to be visited in the future. The Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache operates on the principle that the data most recently accessed is likely to be accessed again in the near future.\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n- You don't have to write an LRU cache from scratch, JabRef depends on a LOT of libraries, some of them provide an LRU cache already, so try to use that if possible.\r\n\r\n",

In JabRef, allocate a new library and copy-paste this minimal BibTeX record:\r\n\r\n> @Electronic{Author,\r\n>   author  = {Some Author},\r\n>   title   = {The Title},\r\n>   url     = {https://somewhere.net/example/address},\r\n>   urldate = {2024-01-19},\r\n> }\r\n\r\n2. `File` -> `Export` this record as type `MS Office 2007 (*.xml)` into a file `test.xml`\r\n\r\n3. The exported file \"test.xml\" mistakenly contains _both_, a \"Title\" and a \"Publicationtitle\" field (highlighted in **_bolditalic_** in the following file dump):\r\n\r\n> <?xml&nbsp;version=\"1.0\"&nbsp;encoding=\"UTF-8\"&nbsp;standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n> <b:Sources&nbsp;xmlns:b=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/bibliography\"&nbsp;xmlns=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/bibliography\"&nbsp;SelectedStyle=\"\">\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:Source>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:BIBTEX_Entry>electronic</b:BIBTEX_Entry>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:SourceType>ElectronicSource</b:SourceType>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**_<b:Title>The&nbsp;Title</b:Title>_**\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:Tag>Author</b:Tag>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:URL>https://somewhere.net/example/address</b:URL>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:YearAccessed>2024</b:YearAccessed>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:MonthAccessed>January</b:MonthAccessed>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:DayAccessed>19</b:DayAccessed>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:Author>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:Author>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:NameList>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:Person>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:Last>Author</b:Last>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:First>Some</b:First>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b:Person>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b:NameList>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b:Author>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b:Author>\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**_<b:PublicationTitle>The&nbsp;Title</b:PublicationTitle>_**\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b:Source>\r\n> </b:Sources>\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the follow-up consequences of the bug in MS Word:\r\n\r\n4. Open a blank MS Word document\r\n\r\n5. Load the file \"test.xml\" via:<ol><li> `References` -> `Manage Sources` -> `Browse‚Ä¶` and then</li><li>select and `Copy ->` the loaded record from the `Sources available in test` pane into the `Current List` pane and</li><li>`Close` the \"Source Manager\" dialog window</li></ol> (the duplicate title is already displayed in the `Preview` pane of the dialog window)\r\n\r\n6. Insert a bibliography into the empty document, via:<ol><li>`References` -> `Bibliography`</li><li>Select the first style, `Bibliography`, offered in the pop-up menu</li></ol>\r\n\r\n7. The inserted bibliography consists of the following record:<br> Author, S. (n.d.). The Title. _The Title_. Retrieved January 19, 2024, from https://somewhere.net/example/address<br>&nbsp;<br>Note the _duplicate_ title.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned at the beginning, the same issue exists for records of type `@Online`, but _not_ for e.g., type `@Book`.\r\n\r\n### Appendix\r\n\r\nRelated Source Code:\r\n\r\nFile `src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/msbib/MSBibConverter.java`:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n   108\t        // TODO: currently only Misc can happen\r\n   109\t        if (\"ElectronicSource\".equals(msBibType) || \"Art\".equals(msBibType) || \"Misc\".equals(msBibType)) {\r\n   110\t            result.publicationTitle = entry.getFieldLatexFree(StandardField.TITLE).orElse(null);\r\n   111\t        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n(addendum 2024-01-20):\r\nIn the meantime I verified that removing the first clause `\"ElectronicSource\".equals(msBibType)` indeed suffices to correct the behavior (kudos to the maintainers of https://devdocs.jabref.org/ ).\r\nI have _not_ investigated the mapping of BibTeX `@misc` to MS&nbsp;Office `Misc` mentioned in https://docs.jabref.org/advanced/knowledge/msofficebibfieldmapping (visited 2024-01-20)).\r\n\r\nSo, the patched lines just read\r\n(File `src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/msbib/MSBibConverter.java`, lines 108ff.):\r\n<pre>\r\n  // TODO: currently only Misc can happen\r\n  // 2024-01-20 balanco@github: removed condition/case \"ElectronicSource\".equals(msBibType)\r\n  //    that generated MS Office bibliographic records with\r\n  //    _duplicate_ \"Title\" and \"Publicationtitle\" fields.\r\n  if (\"Art\".equals(msBibType) || \"Misc\".equals(msBibType)) {\r\n     result.publicationTitle = entry.getFieldLatexFree(StandardField.TITLE).orElse(null);\r\n  }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n&lt;EOT&gt;",

Ultimately only one of your pull-requests will be merged, so if your study course requires you to demonstrage a successfully merged commit this is a risky plan.\r\n   - Supervising two different pull-requests creates more work for maintainers, since they have to hop between pull-requests to compare them and communicate with the both of you.\r\n\r\n### Why not choose another issue?\r\nIn principle, you could work together on this issue (groupwork), but this would require good communication skills on your part. If both of you are willing, you should exchange contact details (e.g. via gitter/e-mail etc.)."

Rename `org.jabref.logic.citationkeypattern.CitationKeyPatternPreferences` to `CitationKeyGenerationPreferences`.\r\n1. Modify `org.jabref.preferences.ExternalApplicationsPreferences#getCiteCommand` to return a `record` having `prefix, delimiter, suffix` as string. There, the value is constructed based on the code at org.jabref.gui.push.AbstractPushToApplication#dissectCiteCommand. - No need to introduce caching there. That could be done as next step. (This code does not run for a long time, so no performance issues expected). Name the `record` `CitationCommandStringPreferences`.\r\n1. Add test cases testing (wrong) preference `\\cite`. It should work nevertheless. It should use `,` as delimiter and `{` as prefix, and `}` as suffix (as fallback if nothing was provided).  Adapt the code of `CitationKeyGenerationPreferences` accordingly. If this is successfully done, https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10568 is fixed.\r\n1. Adapt `getCitePrefix()`, ` getDelimiter()`, and `getCiteSuffix()` to use the introduced `CitationStringPreferences`.\r\n1. Remove `org.jabref.gui.push.AbstractPushToApplication#dissectCiteCommand`.\r\n1. <s>Remove `org.jabref.gui.push.PushToApplication#getDelimiter`\r\n   - Remove method\r\n   - Change parameter at org.jabref.gui.push.PushToApplicationCommand#pushEntries to use `CitationCommandStringPreferences`s delimiter</s> This is wrong; since application's delimiter has higher precedence than the one of the citaton command.\r\n1. Adapt `org.jabref.gui.edit.CopyMoreAction#copyCiteKey` to use the new preference\r\n",

JabRef 5.10 to 5.11.\r\n\r\nQuoting: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10133 \r\n\r\n> I use Pandoc for processing Markdown manuscripts to ODT format. Markdown cite command is `[@key]` instead of LaTeX `\\cite{key}`. In case of multiple citations this is `[@key1; @key2]`. Currently the preference for cite command does not include the `{` and `}` characters, making it impossible to change it to another cite command that does not use curly brackets. Also, the separating character (`,`) cannot be modified.\r\n\r\nQuoting https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10303 with a highlight.\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/935bb57a-0f49-45cf-9ea8-53be3c254013)\r\n\r\nScreenshot of today's JabRef:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/90c084c0-571e-4417-9dcb-dfdee8c09b4e)\r\n\r\nDid you click on the question mark?\r\n\r\nIt leads to https://docs.jabref.org/cite/pushtoapplications\r\n\r\nI highlight the important part.

The current BibEntry is stored in the variable `currentEntry` in the method `init(BibEntry)`. Thus, you should have access in the class... -- Nevertheless, I do not know, why you need that -- You should have a ViewModel at hand at the button... "

Instead of auto-completion, the user could use a drop down field:\r\n\r\n![a](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/3891c49e-c696-4e49-acc9-7c7472219d12)\r\n\r\n### JabRef 5.12\r\n\r\nIn today's JabRef, there is no such possibility:\r\n\r\n![b](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/bc853cb9-0400-4b57-9d20-9949f2965df7)\r\n\r\nOne can still configure the list where the user can choose the available \"keywords\" to offer.\r\n\r\n![c](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/8ac6933f-afca-4d2c-94aa-2621c6e7e7e5)\r\n\r\nOn the left, the field is selected, on the right, the possible contents are shown.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add the selection box next to the keyword field. The list should be filled with the contents of the content selectors list, minus the existing keywords.\r\n   - This box is OUTSIDE the text box. It allows for selecting an item in a pre-defined list. Once a user clicks on the item, it is added alphabetically inside the list. In case the list is not alphabetically sorted, it is added to the end.\r\n- [ ] In the configuration of the \"Content Selectors\", do NOT allow configuration of Fields having the property \"`org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldProperty#PERSON_NAMES`\" (because there are soooo many authors, we think, it does not make sense to use it there)\r\n- [ ] Change the popup to enter types to the combo box for custom entry types\r\n   - old: ![d](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/8e62a42e-5dc7-4292-adcc-a229d9b58286)\r\n   - new: ![e](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/df4f8fa1-fa1c-46fb-9993-da0c89ac0452)\r\n- [ ] Optional: Rewrite the keyword edit to [tags](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/85131/93436), [also called chips](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/112668/93436)\r\n  - Use GemFX Tags Field (https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/GemsFX#tags-field)\r\n  - An example is implemented at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10046\r\n",

Per your included stack overflow hint, the FlexmarkHtmlConverter class lets us do this easily in only one line of code. In order to parse the text being pasted into the \"Abstract\" GUI text box, I'd need to find where that text is stored in the source code (i.e. what variable stores the text). From there I imagine performing a manipulation on that variable with the FlexmarkHtmlConverter class would be fairly simple. Would this adequately resolve the issue? \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if my plan is on the right track, and if so, even a little hint as to where I can find the code for the text boxes would be very much appreciated.

However, no paste handling there. Using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>, I searched for `Clipboard` and found `ClipboardManager`. No help. With <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, I searched `paste` and found `org.jabref.gui.edit.EditAction#execute`. I think, one needs to hook into there.\r\n\r\nJust try. We do not know the solution yet. You are the one searching for the solution."

                "body": "The goal is not to automatically convert the symbols, because while unicode engines like LuaTeX and XeTeX can read the unicode characters, there are problems with older engines like pdfTeX. We can bridge the gap by detecting these characters in JabRef and hope PDFTeX will eventually catch up, or what is more likely: Users will stop using pdfTeX.\r\n\r\nGiven the choice, I would assume most people would prefer not having to convert an `aÃÄ` in their text to\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\`{a}\r\n```\r\njust because their font engine can't read it. They probably would prefer an engine that simply works without having to do magic conversions. By the way it was hard to cite this non-precomposed character in markdown xD\r\n\r\nI am not sure why we would force users that already use more modern unicode engines to convert their precomposed unicode characters like `aÃÄ` back into non-precomposed characters like \r\n```\r\n\\`{a}\r\n```\r\n\r\n in their entries. Manual conversion is fine, but no need for automatic conversion I think, no?\r\n\r\nPdfTeX is still maintained, but there are not a lot of updates to their repo. See here: https://tug.org/applications/pdftex/. [Postscript fonts](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript-Fontformate#Formate), which are natively supported by pdfTeX seem outdated and being dropped by many operating systems and applications, so at one point the reason for pdfTeX's existence will fade away and people will move to other font enginges. I think we should make it hard for users to stick to the outdated pdfTeX and incentivise users switching to unicode compatible engines.\r\n\r\nI propose the path forward for JabRef should be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Have a (long) grace period with a warning that these characters are not supported by pdfTeX and offer converting characters to their unproblematic equivalents, but do not do so automatically, instead offer manual conversion in the cleanup dialogue. The warning should include pointing to alternative modern engines like LuaTeX or XeTeX that support unicode.\r\n2. In a future version of JabRef (very far in the future), drop support for manual conversion and only offer unicode characters."

As @ThiloteE correctly analyzed, the problem is the combination pdftex + biber (in particular the ascii check is not helpful).\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution would be indeed an automatic conversion of unicode characters to the [Normal Form C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence), or at least combine unicode characters if they have an single-character equivalent. So `aÃÄ` can stay the same but [0131 + 0301](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%C4%B1%CC%81) is converted to [00ED](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%C3%AD) (but not to its latex code). Since by definition these unicode representations are the equivalent, lualatex/xetex will display the same character - it's just to help pdftex.\r\nAlternatively, implement it as a save-action that is on by default."

Here, you can search for code.\r\n\r\n## Integrity Check\r\n\r\nThe class is `org.jabref.logic.integrity.IntegrityCheck`. With <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you can navigate to the package in the project view. Then, you find other integrity checks. I browsed around and found `ValueChecker`. Think, the implementation is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Implement `UnicodeNormalFormCCheck` in package `org.jabref.logic.integrity`. It implements interface `ValueChecker`. \r\n   - See https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10506#issuecomment-1820998978 for an implementation hint. \r\n   - Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to generate a skeleton of a test class. You can see other test classes outlining how to implement (e.g., `org.jabref.logic.integrity.BibStringCheckerTest`)\r\n2. Add the `UnicodeNormalFormCCheck` to `org.jabref.logic.integrity.FieldCheckers#getAllMap` (in the biblatex mode branch).\r\n3. Check if it appears in the UI and test it with the example\r\n\r\n## New cleanup action\r\n\r\n1. Create a new formatter `NormalizeUnicodeFormatter` in `org.jabref.logic.formatter.bibtexfields`. Also create test cases\r\n2. Add it to `org.jabref.logic.formatter.Formatters#getOthers`.\r\n3. Check if it appears in the UI and test it with the example"
