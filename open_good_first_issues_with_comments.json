                "body": "Thank you for bringing this up. \n\nSo our preference architecture is built on three layers:\n1. _The `java.util.prefs.Preferences` layer_: which stores settings in XML format using standard Java APIs.\n2. _The `JabRefGuiPreferences` layer_: which parses the XML into a more developer-friendly POJO format, making it easier to use by the view layer.\n3. _The `PreferencesTab` layer_: which represents the state of the actual views in the preferences dialog UI. Things like checkbnox status, list view content, etc.\n\nObviously, synchronization needs to exist between the three layers.\n\nOn the code level, importing preferences calls two functions: `java.util.prefs.Preferences#importPreferences` and `PreferencesTab#setValues`.\n\nThe former updates `layer 1`, while the latter **attempts** to update `layer 3`, but it doesn't succeed because `layer 3` gets its data from `layer 2`, which was not updated, so what `layer 3` gets is outdated data.\n\nClosing the dialog at this point by doing anything but clicking the save button and restarting JabRef should get you the expected preferences that you have imported because at startup JabRef reads from layer 1 (whch was uptodate when we closed JabRef) and initializes the other layers based on it.\n\nHowever, clicking save would write OUTDATED data from `layer 3` to `layer 2`, which will automatically (through binding) update layer 1, with again, outdated data.\n\n**Blue pill**\n\nWe implement a workaround. These are a few suggestions:\n- Close the dialog automatically once preferences are imported and of course show the 'you need to restart warning dialog' (my favorite).\n- Pass a boolean to `PreferenceTab`s to disable saving preferences after user imports preferences.\n\n**Red pill**\nThis one needs much more discussion. We might need to pass a `PreferenceProvider` (an object that knows how to create the preference object and decides whether to return a cached one or create a new one when called) instead of the actual Preference object to views. This was; when `PreferencesTab#setValues` is called, the provider will provide it with the up-to-date preference state from `layer 1`.\n___\n\nI suggest we take the blue pill for now, marking this as a good first issue because it should be easy to handle and discuss the red pill solution more.\n\n\n"

        "description": "As user, I can refine entry's data using a DOI. See https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/getbibtexdatafromdoi#completing-information-based-on-doi-or-isbn for an example.\n\nThen, for any field, it could be possible that information is existing locally (\"Original entry\") and from the DOI (\"Entry from DOI\").\n\nExample:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b445ac-c3e7-440f-a9da-6fdcdf36f616)\n\nHowever, sometimes, the local data is really wrong. In this example, the \"year\" (`1109`) and the \"Entrytype\" (`Misc`).\n\nThe dialog should select the data which could be more right. Here, \"Entrytype\" and \"Year\" should be selected from \"Entry from DOI\":\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c866899-9745-4b55-852d-dd1d8b27bfe4)\n\n### Task\n\n1. Find out how the Merge Entries Dialog is called\n2. Modify it to know that it knows that is called from \"get bibliographic data from DOI\" (or not)\n3. If called from \"get bibliographic data from DOI\", then it should go through all fields existing in both entries and select the ones more \"right\". Implement it for entry type (misc; != misc) and year. - Also use \"DOI\" from the \"DOI\" fetcher (if code-wise clean enough)\n\n### Details\n\nThe dialog currently prioritizes the entry from the library. Sometimes, the data from the library is really wrong.\n\nExample:\n\n```bibtex\n@Misc{,\n  year      = {1109},\n  doi       = {10.1109/IPDPSW55747.2022.00093},\n  publisher = {IEEE},\n}\n```\n\n1. Wrong entry type\n2. Wrong year\n\nWhen the merge entries dialog is started, it should select the more propriate entry type (everything else as MISC is better) and the better year (if year differs more than 10 years, the \"new\" year should be taken)\n\n",

Thus, submit early to provide us time for feedback. Preferrably at least half the time you required to send the initial PR. Then, there will be feedback. Then we pray that you address the feedback. Please keep in mind that some bots will check the minimum requirements. We wish that addressing this will take one day only. Finally, we really hope that contributors appreciate working on a project used by thousands of people worldwide and take their improvements more serious than just a throw-away excersice to get some study credit points. Contributor appreciation motivates us to spend our free time to a) provide individual feedback and b) keep the whole flow running."

        "title": "Web import: New entry should be added to group \"Imported entries\"",
        "url": "https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/12548",
        "description": "As user, I want to know which entries I did import the last times. It is possible to check for the last added entry (https://docs.jabref.org/advanced/entryeditor/timestamp).\n\nAfter an import, the last imported entry is highlighted. If I import multiple entries, only the last one is highlighted. If I repeatedly import entries.\n\nAs user, I have two phases: Searching and importing entries; and clean up of entries. For cleanup, I need to know which entries need clean up. I mix between web search and PDF import. \n\nAfter an import, some tweaks in the bibliographic entries need to be done: Fix of authors, fix of titles. E.g., by applying [Integrity Checks](https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity). Not all of them are \"right\" and need to be manually checked.\n\nAnother use case for marking imported entries is that they are kind of papers one wants to read.\n\nTherefore, JabRef should automatically add entries to a group \"Imported entries\".\n\n### Desired feature\n\n- After web search, new entries should be added to the group \"Imported entries\". The group name can be changed in the preferences:\n- After a PDF is imported, it should also be added to this group\n- After importing from DOI or other web fetchers, it should also be added to this group\n- The feature should only be enabled if enabled in the preferences\n- The name of the group should be (globally) configurable\n\n#### Details\n\nEnable configuring the group to add to:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de9c546-8815-4f32-baec-7c0f04a6877b)\n\n### Code hints\n\n- `org.jabref.gui.externalfiles.ImportHandler#importEntryWithDuplicateCheck(org.jabref.model.database.BibDatabaseContext, org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntry, org.jabref.gui.duplicationFinder.DuplicateResolverDialog.DuplicateResolverResult)`\n- Store `% Imported entries` in the preferences. \n  - In the preference defaults, store `\"% \" + Localization.lang(\"Imported entries\")`\n  -   When getting the preference, check whether the string begins with `%`. If yes. Remove `%` and the space after and lookup using `Localization.lang`.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- Feature wish in the forum: https://discourse.jabref.org/t/mark-entries-imported-into-an-existing-database/1988\n- Description of functionality: https://discourse.jabref.org/t/imported-entries-stay-on-top/189/2\n- ADR to use `%` for default strings https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/11988\n- In JabRef 2.x, wie had a \"marker\" for imported entries\n- Similar feature: Mark and unmark of entries in JabRef: https://web.archive.org/web/20160614075506/https://help.jabref.org/en/MarkingHelp",

Show up before `All entries` group in group view dialog \n\nDirectly below, because, All entries contains all entries and then it is refined.\n\nMaybe, it is time to introduce \"Smart\" as heading as in BibDesk to distinguish auto groups from manual assignment groups\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24296de6-69d9-425e-8764-0630d44ba415)\n\n(Source: https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/)\n\n>  Also, when user create library it should show `All entries` group which is the current scenario\n\nThat group should always be shown.\n\n> or is there any need to show `Imported entries` in the sense that it may contain papers to remind to read later ?\n\nGroup should only be shown if enabled in the preferences. - We do have the feature to show the number of items in a group.

Additionally, I noticed that the year column in the main table (see screenshot ss1) is sorted correctly in numerical order. To handle the sorting logic of that column, the comparator in [src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/util/comparator/NumericFieldComparator.java](https://github.com/copilot/c/url) is used.\n\nTo fix the sorting functionality of the pagetotal column, is it the right approach to use the comparator in [src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/util/comparator/NumericFieldComparator.java](https://github.com/copilot/c/url)?\n\nI also tried to locate where the sorting comparators are used and  I found these codes are executing when a particular field is sorted  by adding debug log \nin [src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/maintable/MainTable.java](url) \n\n`   model.getEntriesFilteredAndSorted().comparatorProperty().bind(\n                this.comparatorProperty().map(comparator -> {\n                    if (comparator == null) {\n                        return null;\n                    }\n                    return (entry1, entry2) -> {\n                        int result = comparator.compare(entry1, entry2);\n                        if (result != 0) {\n                            return result;\n                        }\n                        // If the entries are equal according to the comparator, compare them by their index in the database.\n                        // The comparison should ideally be based on the database index, but retrieving the index takes log(n). See {@link BibDatabase#indexOf}.\n                        // Using the entry ID is also valid since IDs are monotonically increasing.\n                        System.out.println(\"sort logic\");\n                        return entry1.getEntry().getId().compareTo(entry2.getEntry().getId());\n                    };\n                })\n        );`\n\nBut I 'm still finding some difficulties in solving this issue \n\n**So Could you help me clarify my problem-solving path on this issue?**\n \n"

I've just been using global search. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't quite reproduce this issue, although I've had this exception a few times already. It appears to be related to when I use search, the entry list when a group is selected. Also, it seems to happen after JR has been running for a while.\n\n\n### Appendix\n\n...\n<details>\n\n<summary>Log File</summary>\n\n```\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: URI is not absolute\n\tat

The repair amounts to adding a `http://`.\n\nAlternatively, you can stimulate this exception with:\n1. Edit the file field of an entry\n2. Add file link\n3. Copy the URL from the snippet into the \"Link\" field\n4. Choose filetype URL\n5. Press \"add\"\n\nI suppose that the exception will pop up wherever the URL parser is used. I've had some incomplete URLs in my DB files, but JR 6 now complains."

Specifically, I need help with the following:\n\n1. **Finding where JabRef handles tab key events**:\n   - I am not sure which part of the codebase is responsible for handling the tab key navigation within the Entry Editor. Could you provide guidance on where I should look for the relevant logic? (e.g., which file or class deals with tab key handling or keyboard navigation?)\n   \n2. **Implementing the tab key behavior**:\n   - Once I locate the correct file, where would it be best to add the logic that moves focus to the next tab when pressing `Tab` in the last field of a tab? Should this be handled as part of an existing focus traversal policy, or would I need to implement a custom listener?\n\nAny pointers or advice on these two points would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you for your help."

However, I‚Äôve encountered an issue with how JavaFX handles key events when a `TextField` is focused.\n\nFor example, if I create a listener for a `TextField` or even the `EntryEditor`, the listener won't execute while the `TextField` is in focus, as the `TextField` consumes the input before it reaches the listener/handler. This issue is currently evident with the `setupKeyBindings` function, which is intended to initialize shortcuts for navigating the entry editor. Only the \"Ctrl + MINUS\" key seems to work due to what I think is JavaFX handling key inputs before `setupKeyBindings` can.\n\nI‚Äôve tried using `addEventFilter` instead of `addEventHandler`, but the result is the same. I‚Äôve also explored using JavaFX‚Äôs `tabIndex` and focus priority logic to control the order of focus between tabs and fields. So that pressing \"tab\" will cycle through all of the specified components in order. However, since the `Tab` class doesn‚Äôt have built-in `tabIndex` or `focusTraversal` properties, this has proven to be quite a challenge.\n\nI‚Äôm unsure how to proceed or where I should be focusing my efforts. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated thankyou.\n"

                "body": "> Your text did not include a link to `org.jabref.gui.fieldeditors.FieldEditorFX#establishBinding`. Did you see this method?\n\nAh! Good to know. I implemented this feature by setting up a method in ` FieldEditorFX`  that moves the `TabPane` to the next tab if the user presses \"Tab\" while in the last `TextField` of the current tab. I created a method in `EntryEditor` that checks if the current `TextField` in focus is the last one by comparing its ID with the `Tab`'s  last `Field`'s name. Previously, each `TextField` didn‚Äôt have an ID set, so I updated this by setting each ID to the name of its original `Field`.\n\n**Reasons for this approach:**\n1. **EntryEditor context requirement:** We can't directly check if the current `Field` in focus is the last without `EntryEditor` context. Because of the way `TextFields` are created, we can‚Äôt directly locate the last `TextField` of a `Tab`, but we can easily identify the last `Field` in a tab. To bridge this gap, I assigned IDs to each `TextField` based on their original `Field` names, allowing for comparison.\n2. **Adheres to Field creation policy:** This approach adapts to changes in the last `TextField` depending on the active `Tab`, as all `TextFields` are initially created as `Fields`. Because each `TextField` is linked to a corresponding `Field` (with its ID matching the field's name), and the last field in a tab can always be identified through the `shownFields` method, all `TextField`s can be checked as the last `TextField`.\n\n**Alternative approach:** Another way to address this issue could be to modify the focus traversal list, so pressing \"Tab\" while a `TextField` is in focus cycles through the fields until reaching the last one, then moves to the next `Tab`. However, after spending a short while exploring this option it shows its challenges.\n\nIf you‚Äôre happy with this implementation, I can create a PR for you to review. Thank you!\n"

The script has to exit to send back the result to the browser, but the open JabRef instance might still have the file open, so the script can't delete it before exiting.\r\n\r\nBeing able to send the file as stdin, or as a command-line argument, instead of creating a temporary file, could be a solution for this issue.

But some of the bibtex can be quite long and then you hit the maximum length of the command line argument. \r\n\r\nIs it really important to you to delete the temporary file? Windows 10+ normally clean the temp folder automatically, so it shouldn't really be a problem that there are still files lying around. I honestly don't see a clean way to clean them up, since as you say we need to return as fast as possible from the script.\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps work to pass a `--deleteWhenClosing` cmd line arg to jabref's main exe, and then clean up the file when the main jabref program is closed - but that feels a bit overkill.\r\n"

On Windows, it is located at `%APPDATA%\\..\\local\\org.jabref\\jabref`. JabRef should make use of this folder.\r\n- As default, JabRef offers the \"JabRef built in list\" only\\\r\n    ![a](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/76f6ac0c-fd7f-4596-bb7d-5062199a117a)\r\n- Custom journal abbreviations are shown as file name\\\r\n   ![b](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/da105e0f-9b8c-4253-bc0a-1a2299cf819b)\r\n- Currently, the user has to choose the directory for each file\r\n\r\n## Feature\r\n\r\nJournal abbreviation lists should be placed in a single directory.\r\nAs default, that directory is `%APPDATA%\\..\\local\\org.jabref\\jabref`\\journal-abbreviations` (Windows)\r\n\r\n- User can change the directory (in the preference dialog. The directory is stored as preference)\r\n- JabRef creates `custom.csv` in that directory if it does not exist. This way, JabRef always has a .csv available in the preferences, which the user can choose (to add new abbreviations to)\r\n- JabRef should automatically detect journal lists in that directory and process it:\r\n  - JabRef automatically converts the .csv files there in .mv store files if the timestamp of the csv is newer (\"compilation\" by JabRef). This especially includes `custom.csv` from before\r\n  - JabRef knows the lists by listing `*.mv` in that directory\r\n",

I mean that, for a shared library, the files _need_ to be in a shared/common location -- why would the files for the local library be in that _same_ location?\r\nHowever, I'm sure that for the set of JabRef users, you will probably find a user/situation where file copying would not be desirable. üòÖ \r\n\r\nOne could ask the user on drop/paste for the desired behaviour.\r\nLet's say we drag/drop (or copy/paste) one or more entries from library A to library B:\r\n1. For every entry:\r\n1. If the entry has one or more files, for every file:\r\n2. Check if the file can be accessed from library **A** (according to its user/general/... directory settings) with the defined file path. \r\n    * If not, this indicates a pre-existing problem, abort and report.\r\n3. Check if the file can be accessed from library **B** (according to its user/general/... directory settings) with the defined file path. \r\n    * If yes, both libraries store to the same location, and we're done.\r\n    * If not, the file entry would be broken after copying, so we have to do something:\r\n    * Ask the user if they want to copy the file copied (default?), move the file (if desired?), or the path in the entry deleted.\r\n      *  If copy, copy the file to the destination in **B** according to the \"Download fulltext\" functionality.\r\n      *  If we allow moving, delete it in the source entry to not break _that_ entry. (if you want that?)\r\n      *  If delete, delete the file path from the entry that is pasted.\r\n      * Maybe have a \"use this action for all files in this entry/all remaining entries\" checkbox if there is more than one file.\r\n\r\nIt seems like with this approach, you can't produce entries with invalid file paths when copy/pasting, which seems desirable to me.\r\nDoes that sound useable/feasible to you? Could of course be tweaked by preference settings.\r\n"

The textfield we added is to store the shared library's directory path so we can properly copy the linked file to the right place. Our changes so far can be seen in the draft PR [https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/12854](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/12854).

        "description": "As user, I want to create a new entry type. For example, a new entry type \"Person\" with \"name\" and \"googlescholar\" as fields. JabRef offers advanced field handling for names, URLs, and more. This is implemented using `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldProperty`. The current dialog enables only the addition and deletion of fields. Not assigning field properties or changing the name.\r\n\r\nThus, TODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Enable setting zero ore more `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldProperty`s. Should be done in a combo-box allowing multiple selections.\r\n- [x] ~~Enable update of name:  I cannot fix typos in the name -- it should be possible to double click the name and then change the value:~~\r\n- [x] ~~Optional: Enable casing: I tried to add \"GoogleScholar\", but I could not type the capital \"s\". I think, users should be allowed to use arbitrary casing?~~\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1366654/236176990-512d82c4-7a3c-466a-8022-5268ceab97af.png)\r\n\r\n### More information\r\n\r\n- User documentation of the feature available at https://docs.jabref.org/setup/customentrytypes. \r\n- Markdown for the documentation (to modify) at https://github.com/JabRef/user-documentation/blob/main/en/setup/customentrytypes.md\r\n- Fields can also have no property. That means, it is a plain text, single line text field.

                "body": "@eric052199 For me, it is not clear, what is unclear to you ^^.\r\n\r\nI try to write a few text on \"Enable setting zero ore more org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldPropertys.\" Please ask which item should I refine or if you need additional information.\r\n\r\n1. The class [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldProperty.java#L3](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldProperty.java#L3) models properties of a field\r\n2. An EntryType specifies which fields are contained\r\n3. Custom Entry types are stored in [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/types/UnknownEntryType.java#L8](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/types/UnknownEntryType.java#L8)\r\n4. Custom Fields are stored in [org.jabref.model.entry.field.UnknownField](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/UnknownField.java#L12)\r\n5. From the UI, a new Custom Entry Type is generated at [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewCustomEntryType](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel.java#L130)\r\n6. [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel#addNewField](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/CustomEntryTypesTabViewModel.java#L145) is used to add a new field to the customized entry type\r\n7. There, [org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.FieldViewModel](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/preferences/customentrytypes/FieldViewModel.java#L26) class is used to put a single FieldProperty. The issue is to be able to add more than one property\r\n8. JabRef saves the customized entry types into the .bib file:\\\r\n   ```bibtex\r\n   @Comment{jabref-entrytype: person: req[Name] opt[Googlescholar;Orcid]}\r\n   ```\r\n9. an example person looks as follows:\\\r\n   ```bibtex\r\n   @Person{demo,\r\n     name          = {Oliver Kopp},\r\n     googlescholar = {https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=nB2GungAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao},\r\n     orcid         = {https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6962-4290},\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n10. Proposal for the new format: Use `|` to separate field names with the list field properties: \r\n  - `@Comment{jabref-entrytype-v2: person: req[Name|PERSON_NAME] opt[Googlescholar|EXTERNAL;Orcid|EXTERNAL]}`\r\n  - `@Comment{jabref-entrytype-v2: customizedtype: req[title;author;date] opt[year;month;publisher]}`\r\n  - Note that is not necessary to provide properties to already known field names. It is not possible to overwrite field properties (currently). Reason: Parsing logic at [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L76](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L76). You can think of changing this in your implementation. But take this as optional.\r\n  - New field properties can be added by passing them at [/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L90](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/entry/field/FieldFactory.java#L90)\r\n   ```java\r\n      .orElse(new UnknownField(fieldName));\r\n   ```\r\n  - Note that I added `-v2`, because the new format is NOT backwards-compatible with the old one and thus JabRef users might loose data if they switch versions back and forth.\r\n  - Note that there might be no field properties given. See discussion at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3251.\r\n  - The proposal is NOT backwards-compatible. We can also come up with a completely new format. Nested JSON. Then, the string after `jabref-entrytype-v2:` needs to be forwarded to a JSON parser. \r\n\r\nHints:\r\n\r\n1. IDE hint: By holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then click with the mouse on an identifier, you can navigate to the usage of a class, method, etc.\r\n2. IDE hint: By holding<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, you can search all text occurrences. Helpful to find some code.\r\n3. Please try to understand the current UI\r\n4. Add a sketch of the new UI - maybe this helps to understand the issue more\r\n5. Define the new data format for writing `jabref-entrytype`\r\n6. Add test cases for the new data format. The tests should go into [org.jabref.logic.exporter.MetaDataSerializerTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/logic/exporter/MetaDataSerializerTest.java#L31). \r\n7. A new test class for [org.jabref.logic.importer.util.MetaDataParser](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/util/MetaDataParser.java#L32). Needs to be created. This can be done with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd>. `parseCustomEntryType` should be tested.\r\n8. You can also work on `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactoryTest`, because `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactory` is called in `MetaDataParser`.\r\n9. Other tests are in [org.jabref.model.entry.BibEntryTypesManagerTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/model/entry/BibEntryTypesManagerTest.java#L158)\r\n11. More tests should go into [org.jabref.logic.exporter.BibtexDatabaseWriterTest](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/d81d37faaddd45257e445f1978f97994043dd2d4/src/test/java/org/jabref/logic/exporter/BibtexDatabaseWriterTest.java#L69)\r\n12. Please do test-driven development. Thus, please add test cases and then use the debugger to step into the methods. Then change the methods. With that, you save development time. If you use the GUI to test your implementation, you will be slow in developing."

I'm wondering the timing that allow user to set the field properties. Following are my thoughts right now:\r\n1.

This is OK, because GUI coding is hard. However, there should be a change for the average user to check the field properties. Currently, they are only visible in the code.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/1366654/4dbfac29-b23b-489f-ae3f-d3b5dfe9c5a3)\r\n\r\nCase 2: \r\n\r\n- Checking if it is a standard field: Do not duplicate \"semantics\" of code. Please use `org.jabref.model.entry.field.FieldFactory#parseField(java.lang.String)`: `boolean isStandardField = FieldFactory.parseField(name) instanceOf StandardField;`. I read from your  code that you already have an instance of Field at hand. Thus, you can just use `instanceof` there. Note that I could not provide the full code, because `fieldsForAdding` is IMHO the list of all fields available in the combo box. We are talking about the place where a new entry is added.\r\n- The screenshot is strange. It is \"CitationKey\", which should also be forbidden, because it is an InternalField (add it to your thinking of case 1).\r\n- Let's discuss concrete examples. Then, you also have a base for test cases. Let's assume the user wants to add `exampleCustomField`. The user selected properties `DATE` and `DOI`. This is a strange selection. I think, you are beginning to discuss, which FieldProperties are mutually exclusive. I think, `org.jabref.model.entry.field.StandardField` is a good list of field property combinations. Nearly none of the fields have more than one property. Only exception `FieldProperty.EXTERNAL, FieldProperty.VERBATIM` for `URL` - and `UserSpecificCommentField`: `FieldProperty.COMMENT, FieldProperty.MULTILINE_TEXT`. --> And more thinking: `FILE_EDITOR` and `EXTERNAL` implies `VERBATIM`. `COMMENT` implies `MULTILINE_TEXT`. Thus, I **change** the specification: Allow the user to select **at most one** field property. If the Field is generated, AND the property is `FILE_EDITOR`, `EXTERNAL`, `COMMENT`, then add the implied property **at the end of the viewModel**, which is `org.jabref.gui.preferences.customentrytypes.FieldViewModel#toField`.\r\n\r\nCase 3: Correct.\r\n\r\n"

For those entries, the program should check if the file name and the full path are valid (exists and matches to some file in the local folders). If either of these do not exist then the entry name (entry ID) should be kept in an array, as well as the file‚Äôs name. \r\nThen, the Search for unlinked local files begins in the local machine as it is done currently. The filename saved as mentioned above shall be searched for locally. If found the path of this unlinked file should be added to the previous array as a new addition.\r\n\r\nIf (a) the file is not found, or (b) the path is not recognized and a file with the same name is found in a different folder the user should be informed with the display of the right message. Also, the user should be advised to (a) delete the file input or (b) change the file path.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, a fitting message shall appear on the screen informing the user that:\r\na)\tThe file path or name of an entry is not found or matched to a local file.\r\n\r\nb)\tThe file path of an entry is not matched and a file with the specific name is found in the local folder.\r\n\r\n***For example, as mentioned in the issue the message shall be:***\r\n\r\na)\tEntry: test, file: a.pdf\r\nFile name or path not found or matched to a local file.\r\nYou are advised to delete the file input as it is not valid.\r\n\r\nb)\tEntry: test, file: a.pdf\r\nInvalid file path. File named: a.pdf found on local folder: folder-a.\r\nYou can automatically change file path by selecting entry and using the ‚ÄúAutomatically set file links‚Äù key (F7).\r\n\r\nLastly, when the Automatically set files link key is pressed the program shall change the file path to the new full path of the file with the same name found unless more than one file has the same name.\r\n\r\n***Please inform me about your thoughts on this approach.***\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nAlexandra Stathopoulou"

Craft JUnit tests\r\n\r\nMaybe, 2 and 3 can be done in a loop\r\n\r\nTest Settings:\r\n\r\n* Create a test directory for each directory\r\n* Create a sub directory for the setting **before** the move - let's name that dir A\r\n* Create another (!) sub directory for the setting **after** the move - let's name that dir B\r\n* The bib file should reside in dir A. Set `.` in the library properties as pdf directory\r\n* Run \"Automatically set file links\" - check that the bib file was not modified\r\n* Copy the bib file from A to B\r\n* Open the bib file in JabRef\r\n* Run \"Automatically set file links\" - check that the bib file was modified as desired (in case everything was implemented. At the beginning, JabRef should have done nothing)\r\n\r\nHint: You can use git to version the test setting locally. Use `git init` and then `git gui` together with the staging area to track changes. No need to commit at each try. You can use the revert functionality of git gui."

They can trigger heated debate and follow up pull-requests.\r\n\r\nJabRef maintainers have not yet discussed this particular issue themselves. Until this has been done, please check out other issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are pretty new to open source programming, have a look at issues with the tag \"[good first issues](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/good%20first%20issue)\". If you are a student, the \"[candidates for university  projects](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/projects/9)\" page offers some issues of varying difficulty and scope and that have been estimated to be compatible with university courses as well and often bring a larger feature to JabRef. Of course, feel free to tackle one of the other \"normal\" issues around, if you feel you have the knowledge or the willingness to take them on. There are many around!\r\n\r\nBecause there are so many, **prioritization** would boost JabRef's development. For example, if you have decided to work on a issue related to \"search\", have a look at multiple issues with the label \"search\" and only afterwards decide on which one you want to work on. What should be avoided: Having a look at the newest issues and blindly choose an issue from the first page. Thank you! There might be important issues on the first page, but there might also be very important issues further down the list. [Labels](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc) will help you a lot. Furthermore, [bugs](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/projects/5) are actively prioritized by JabRef maintainers and getting rid of high priority ones feels extra nice!\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, at the end of the day, of course, you are the one free to choose what to work on and what feature you prefer JabRef to have. Such is the nature of open source software.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

In particular:\r\n\r\n`Import by ID` (green colour), which automatically searches through various ID sources (e.g. DOI, ISBN, etc.) is not perfect. I heard, under certain circumstances it could be that it does not find IDs that could be found if users were to select them manually using the `select entry type` dialogue (also green colour). I assume because the algorithm under the hood is forced to operate within a hierarchy, if duplicate metadata is found. Either first come, first served, or some duplicate prevention mechanism kicks in. I don't know the exact code though, so I could be wrong, but if this is right, getting rid of the manual option as I proposed back then might be a bad idea. Also, there are some other things I don't like as much today as I did like it back then :D It was just a draft, not final.\r\n\r\nAlso, @claell I would be happy, if you also could provide a detailed draft UI. We need a sensible outline of how the future UI should or could look like :)\r\n\r\n"

                "body": "Side note: Reasoning for the first button: Quickly create an entry without having an extra dialog. The decision driver was to have as less modals as possible.\r\n\r\n## Discussion Result\r\n\r\n- One modal. Title: \"New entry\" (base on the code of dialog \"Select entry type\"\r\n- The entry dialog has three tabs\r\n- First tab: \"New entry based on type\". (Reason: New comers are more knowledgable of BibTeX types and thus are not confused)\r\n- Second tab: \"New entry based on identifier\" (Reason: For the power users, this tab is focused when opening the dialog again and again - see below \"acress sessions\")\r\n- The tab \"New entry based on identifier\" contains a hint text below stating \"You can also paste a DOI into the entry table to have JabRef creating the entry directly.\"\r\n- Third tab: \"New entry from text\". (Reason: This is the functionality needed the least)\r\n- Fourth tab: \"New entry from BibTeX\". Have a text field where BibTeX code can be pasted. The entry is created and then focused. In case of multiple entries, all of them are created, and the first one is focused in the table and the entry editor opens for that entry. In case of a parsing error, the error is displayed and the dialog kept open for the user to try to fix the BibTeX code.\r\n- JabRef remembers the focused tab across JabRef sessions. That means: As user, I select the second tab. I create an entry. I save. I close JabRef. I reopen JabRef. I open the \"New entry\" dialog. The second tab is focused. Hint: Use JabRef's preferences.\r\n- Modify key binding functionality for \"New entry from plain text\" (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>. This opens the new entry dialog, switches to the tab \"New entry from text\" and focuses the text field\r\n- If possible: Add key binding functionality for \"New entry from identifier\"\r\n  - Add `Library -> \"New entry from identifier\"` with shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (because <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> is \"New InBook\").\r\n- Remove buttons \"New article\", \"Import by ID\", \"New entry from plain text\"\r\n- Make the default size of the dialog wider (try to use 1000px)\\\r\n  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1366654/172222551-965685f9-81f9-4d44-b526-f31ccf2649fb.png)\r\n\r\n## Decision Drivers\r\n\r\n- As less clicks as possible\r\n- Less cluttered UI\r\n- Be \"easy\" for both newcomers and professional users "
